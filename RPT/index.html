    <p>
      Hi, my name is Caden Baird, and I’m the CEO at Rexburg Physical Therapy. I
      received my doctorate from BYU, and have been practicing PT (Physical
      Therapy) for 10 years. To start off, let me offer a question. Have you
      ever had bad experiences with PT? Our company's mission is to expand our
      business opening clinics in Utah, Washington, and Oregon. What makes our
      company different is our friendly and supportive staff. We also have
      unique equipment that proves to be advantageous such as underwater
      treadmills and anti-gravity treadmills. Maybe one day you’ll be in need of
      Physical Therapy, and by being familiar with our company you’d know that
      the best option to choose is us for your physical therapy needs.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <h3>A little bit about our business...</h3>
    <p>
      We have ran this Physical Therapy company for about 10 years now, and it's
      time to open clinics in other locations. Some of our PT/PTAs have been
      with us since we have opened such as Isaiah, Rebecca, and Lindsay. We have
      received "Best Physical Therapy Clinic" of 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022. Our
      clinic has helped numerous individuals whether they be elderly, athletes,
      or patients who've undergone surgery have a speedy recovery.
